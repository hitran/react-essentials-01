# React Project with Unit Tests and TypeScript
This repository demonstrates the gradual improvement of a React project by progressively introducing unit tests and TypeScript for better code quality, maintainability, and scalability. It showcases how a typical React project evolves as we add testing, type safety, and refactor the code to make it more robust.

# Project overview
This project is a simple React app built with the intention to gradually enhance it by:

Adding unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
Refactoring the code to incorporate TypeScript for static typing and better developer experience.
Throughout the development process, various features and components are refactored to:

Ensure test coverage is added for critical paths.
Introduce type safety to avoid bugs related to implicit type conversions.
By the end of this project, the React app will be fully equipped with unit tests and TypeScript support, demonstrating a high level of confidence in the codebase.
